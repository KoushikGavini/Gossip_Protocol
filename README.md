# Instructions

### Step 1: Start the Gossip Nodes
#TODO(Koushikg): dockerize nodes so it is easier to setup env
* start nodes separately in each terminal
* example: 

```shell
python Gossip_node_7000.py
```
### Step 2: Enter a message
* Enter a message from any node and view other node's terminal as the message is received
```shell
Node started on port 7000
Susceptible nodes => [7010, 7020]
Enter a message to send:

hello from 7000
```
